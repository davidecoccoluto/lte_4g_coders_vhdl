function [z, x] = constituent_encoder(c)
% CONSTITUENT_ENCODER encodes a code block using a terminated unity-rate
% recursive convolutional code having 3 memory elements, a generator
% polynomial of [1,1,0,1] and a feedback polynomial of [1,0,1,1], as
% specified in Section 5.1.3.2.1 and 5.1.3.2.2 of TS36.212.
%   [z, x] = CONSTITUENT_ENCODER(c) encodes a code block, in order to
%   obtain a sequence of systematic and termination bits, as well as a
%   sequence of encoded bits.
%
%   c should be a row vector, comprising the K bits of a code block.
%
%   z will be a row vector, comprising K+3 encoded bits.
%
%   x will be a row vector, comprising K systematic bits, appended with 3
%   termination bits.
