function d = turbo_encoder(c, pi)
% TURBO_ENCODER encodes a code block using a turbo code, as
% specified in Section 5.1.3.2 of TS36.212.
%   d = TURBO_ENCODER(c, pi) encodes a code block, using a specified
%   interleaver pattern.
%
%   c should be a row vector, comprising the K bits of a code block.
%
%   pi should be a row vector of length K, containing unique indices in the range
%   0 to K-1, arranged according to the turbo code interleaver pattern,
%   such that interleaving can be achieved according to c_prime = c(pi+1);
%
%   d will be a matrix of encoded bits, comprising 3 rows and K+4 columns.
